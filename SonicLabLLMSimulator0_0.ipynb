Geologists are eager to explore interesting geological features such as mountains, volcanoes, and valleys, none of which are located anywhere near this location.  It would be nearly impossible to explore the ice-rich Martian poles from if the base is located in Argyre. Follow the water is the approach to finding signs of life on Mars.  Argyre has already been researched extensively by previous rovers, and there is no evidence of surface lakes or streams in this location. This is disappointing because it is unlikely that we would find fossils in the dusty sands of this location. The element carbon is a fundamental building block of life. Knowing where carbon is present and in what form would tell us a lot about where life might have developed. Argyre is centrally located to provide easy access to some of the Martian regions believed to have the highest carbon concentration. Locating the base in Argyre would significantly delay scientists' goal of mapping out the climate of Mars. The Climate Modeling System needs to be constantly updated with new data about temperature, winds, pressure, etc. in order to generate reliable weather forecasts of Martian climate. This location experiences so many extreme weather events that sensing equipment would have to be dismantled for weeks at a time. This means the project will take two to three times longer if the base is located here. \",\n",
        "                \"Casius\": \"Casius may hold the key to understanding the forces that have fueled irreversible climate change on Mars. Scientists studying climate change on Earth are especially eager to receive data from the Casius region as it may enable them to understand how climate change can be slowed on Earth. Air samples taken throughout Casius show unusually high concentrations of methane gas in the atmosphere. Methane is a byproduct of living organisms! This makes Casius a top priority for finding life, if it exists, on Mars. Casius experiences mild but absolutely fascinating earthquakes. Though these earthquakes would pose little threat to life or property, they are a geology treasure trove for scientists. Understanding these Marsquakes is a critical science goal for the Mars Science Program. On Earth, all forms of life need water to survive. It is likely, though not certain, that if life ever evolved on Mars, it did so in the presence of a long-standing supply of water. On Mars, we need to search for evidence of life in areas where liquid water was once stable, and below the surface where it still might exist today. Researchers at the Italian Space Agency found evidence of a large subglacial lake in Casius that may be the most likely place to find traces of life. If there is microbial life on Mars, scientists believe it may be located in the subsurface lava tubes. Unfortunately, there are no lava tubes at or within a reasonable driving distance from Casius. Locating the base here would be a major setback for scientists who are eager to explore these lava tubes for signs of life.\",\n",
        "                \"Diacria\": \"Diacria is utterly disappointing from a science and discovery perspective because it has only trace amounts of methane gas in the atmosphere. Methane is a byproduct of living organisms, and so many scientists are skeptical about finding evidence of microbial life here. Diacria experiences very consistent and non-variable climate conditions. This is bad when you are gathering data for a climate model. Building robust and trustworthy climate models require fluctuations in wind and other atmospheric conditions in order to accurately calibrate the models. Scientists estimate that if the base is located here, it could take 10 years or more to build an accurate climate model needed for future exploration and habitation of Mars. Climate data suggests there may be hot spots located in Diacria where hydrothermal pools (like those at Yellowstone) provide places for life. A recent reanalysis of data from Mars Global Surveyor suggests that Diacria is extremely unique in that liquid water may exist in a reservoir just below the surface. Finding water is the key to finding evidence of life on Mars.\",\n",
        "                \"Eridania\": \"Eridania is a real humdrum for climate scientists. The climate in this location has already been extensively mapped out by the Curiosity rover. There is little in the way of new climate knowledge to be gained from placing the base here. Climate data suggests that Eridania is one of the coldest places on the planet. It is highly unlikely that there are any hot spots nearby. Heat is important to finding life, if it exists. Hot spots are where life forms would likely collect, as they do in high concentration in the hydrothermal pools at Yellowstone. Eridania is a rare gem for understanding the history of Mars. Mars has the greatest diversity of impact craters of any planet in the Solar System. These impact craters, made by objects crashing into the surface over the course of thousands of years, hold keys to understanding the geology of Mars at each time period. There are more impact craters in this particular location than in any other location on Mars. Eridania is a gateway to one of the Martian poles, given the large amount of ice that is known to be at the poles, this is a top priority location to search for evidence of life. Given the enormous cost of the Mission to Mars, choosing a location that will enable new scientific advances is a top priority for every nation who is funding the mission. NASA's Curiosity rover found complex organic compounds in samples of mudstone rocks that were taken from a dry lake in Eridania! These compounds closely resemble those found on Earth that are associated with microbial life forms. \"\n",
